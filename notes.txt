1. this link is what worked when I tried to set up tailwind: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs
2. npm run dev to make it open in localhost
3. have to be cd into studio to run sanity start
4. npm install react-icons 
5. you can name a query paramter in the route something by saying collections>[name_of_query_param].js
So what happens then is if the link says http://localhost:3000/collections/0x66a576A977b7Bccf510630E0aA5e450EC11361Fa
then the computer goes to collecitons folder > assigns whatever is after collections/ to the value 
of name_of_query_param. THAT IS SO COOL!
^^I could use that to determine which flowchart needs to be displayed right?
